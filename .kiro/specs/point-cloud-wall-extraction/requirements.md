WHEN a user selects a drawn line segment and chooses delete
THE SYSTEM SHALL remove the selected line segment from the view

### 墙面提取算法需求

**R9: 半自动墙面拟合**
WHEN a user has drawn guide line segments on the point cloud
THE SYSTEM SHALL use these segments to fit nearby point cloud data and extract building wall structures

**R10: RANSAC平面拟合**
WHEN the wall extraction algorithm is executed
THE SYSTEM SHALL use RANSAC or similar algorithms to fit vertical planes near the drawn line segments

**R11: 墙面边界提取**
WHEN vertical planes are fitted
THE SYSTEM SHALL extract wall boundaries and corner points to generate regularized wall geometry

**R12: 自动墙面识别**
WHEN a user chooses automatic mode
THE SYSTEM SHALL automatically identify building walls without manual annotation using advanced point cloud processing algorithms

### 线框图生成需求

**R13: 2D线框图生成**
WHEN wall extraction is completed
THE SYSTEM SHALL generate a 2D wireframe drawing similar to CAD floor plans

**R14: DXF格式导出**
WHEN a user chooses to export the generated wireframe
THE SYSTEM SHALL save the result in DXF format compatible with CAD software

**R15: 线框图元素包含**
WHEN generating the wireframe drawing
THE SYSTEM SHALL include wall outlines, door/window openings, and other architectural elements

### 用户界面需求

**R16: 工具栏功能**
WHEN the application is launched
THE SYSTEM SHALL provide a toolbar with core functionality buttons (no more than 8 buttons)

**R17: 状态栏反馈**
WHEN any operation is performed
THE SYSTEM SHALL display current operation status and hints in the status bar

**R18: 属性面板**
WHEN an object is selected
THE SYSTEM SHALL show a collapsible properties panel displaying object attributes

### 性能需求

**R19: 大数据量处理**
WHEN loading point cloud files with millions of points
THE SYSTEM SHALL process and display the data within 5 seconds

**R20: 实时交互响应**
WHEN user performs view operations
THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain frame rate above 30fps for smooth interaction

**R21: 墙面提取性能**
WHEN wall extraction algorithm is executed
THE SYSTEM SHALL complete the process within 30 seconds for typical building datasets

### 系统集成需求

**R22: 模块化集成**
WHEN the new functionality is added to the existing system
THE SYSTEM SHALL integrate as an independent module without affecting original system functionality

**R23: 配置独立性**
WHEN new features are configured
THE SYSTEM SHALL manage configuration items independently without impacting original system settings

**R24: 代码隔离**
WHEN new code is added
THE SYSTEM SHALL be placed in independent namespaces or modules to avoid polluting existing code

### 数据格式支持需求

**R25: 多格式点云支持**
WHEN importing point cloud data
THE SYSTEM SHALL support PCD (ASCII, binary, compressed), PLY (ASCII, binary), LAS, LAZ, XYZ, and TXT formats

**R26: 坐标系统处理**
WHEN loading LAS files
THE SYSTEM SHALL correctly handle WKT coordinate system definitions and support UTM, geographic coordinate systems

**R27: 属性信息利用**
WHEN processing LAS files
THE SYSTEM SHALL utilize classification information, intensity, RGB colors to assist building identification and optimize visualization

### 错误处理需求
